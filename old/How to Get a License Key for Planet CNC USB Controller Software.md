A license key is a unique code that identifies your Planet CNC controller and unlocks the full functionality of the software. Without a license key, you can only use the software in demo mode, which limits the number of commands you can execute and disables some features.
  
So how do you get a license key for Planet CNC USB Controller software? Here are the steps you need to follow:
  
1. First, you need to purchase a Planet CNC controller from their official website or an authorized dealer. You can choose from different models depending on your needs and budget. Each controller comes with a serial number that is required for obtaining a license key.
2. Next, you need to download and install the Planet CNC TNG software from their website. This is the latest version of their software that supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. You can also download older versions of their software if you prefer.
3. Then, you need to connect your Planet CNC controller to your computer via USB cable and launch the Planet CNC TNG software. The software will automatically detect your controller and display its serial number in the status bar.
4. After that, you need to request a license key from Planet CNC by filling out a form on their website. You will need to provide your name, email address, controller serial number, and proof of purchase (such as an invoice or receipt). You will also need to agree to their terms and conditions.
5. Finally, you will receive an email from Planet CNC with your license key code. You need to copy and paste this code into the Planet CNC TNG software by clicking on Help/License Management/Licenses. Then click on Import and OK. Your license key will be activated and you can enjoy using the software without any limitations.

That's it! You have successfully obtained and activated a license key for Planet CNC USB Controller software. Now you can control your CNC machine with ease and precision. If you have any questions or issues, you can contact Planet CNC's support team or visit their forum for help.
  
## What are the Features and Benefits of Planet CNC USB Controller Software?
  
Planet CNC USB Controller software is not just a simple program that sends commands to your CNC machine. It is a powerful and versatile software that offers many features and benefits for CNC enthusiasts and professionals alike. Here are some of the main features and benefits of Planet CNC USB Controller software:

- It supports up to 9 axes of motion control for stepper and servo motors, with different kinematics options such as H-bot, CoreXY, and transformation matrix.
- It uses USB or Ethernet connection for fast and reliable communication between your computer and your controller. You don't need a parallel port or a special cable to connect your devices.
- It has a user-friendly interface that allows you to create and edit G-code programs, jog and home your machine, monitor the status and position of your axes, and more. You can also use a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, or a pendant for manual control.
- It supports standard RS274/NGC G-code format that is compatible with most CAM software such as SolidCAM, MasterCAM, ArtCAM, Vectric, CamBam, MeshCAM, etc. It also supports advanced G-codes such as cutter radius compensation, tool length offsets, coordinate system origins, etc.
- It can import toolpaths from various file formats such as DXF, PLT/HPGL, image files, NC-Drill (Excellon), Gerber (RS-274X), etc. You can also export toolpaths to G-code or DXF files for further editing or sharing.
- It has a built-in toolpath simulation feature that allows you to preview your program before running it on your machine. You can check for errors, collisions, or unwanted movements and make adjustments if needed.
- It has a homing procedure that automatically moves your machine to a predefined position and sets the zero point for your coordinates. You can also use limit switches or sensors to detect the end of travel of your axes.
- It has a tool change procedure that prompts you to change the tool when needed and automatically adjusts the tool length offset. You can also use a tool length sensor to measure the length of your tool automatically.
- It has a spindle synchronization feature that allows you to control the speed and direction of your spindle with PWM signals or RC servo signals. You can also use a spindle encoder and an index signal to synchronize your spindle with your feed rate for threading operations.
- It has an SD card support feature that allows you to run G-code programs from an SD card without using a computer. You can also use an LCD display and buttons to control your machine.
- It has an external device support feature that allows you to control external devices such as relays, solenoids, lasers, etc. with digital outputs or PWM outputs. You can also use digital inputs or analog inputs to receive signals from external devices such as switches, sensors, probes, etc.
- It has an API (application programming interface) feature that allows you to write your own custom software or plugins for Planet CNC USB Controller software. You can also use SDK (software development kit) to access the low-level functions of the controller.
- It has an integrated web server feature that allows you to monitor the state and send commands to your controller via a web browser on any device connected to the same network.

As you can see, Planet CNC USB Controller software is a comprehensive and flexible software that can meet your CNC needs and expectations. Whether you are a hobbyist or a professional, you can benefit from using this software to control your CNC machine with ease and precision.
